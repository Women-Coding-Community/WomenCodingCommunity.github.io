## Find something to work on

The first step to getting starting contributing is to find something
to work on. Help is always welcome, and no contribution is too small!

Here are some things you can do today to get started contributing:

1. You can browse the issues labeled as [help wanted](https://github.com/WomenCodingCommunity/WomenCodingCommunity.github.io/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22help+wanted%22) and [good first issue](https://github.com/WomenCodingCommunity/WomenCodingCommunity.github.io/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22) to see who is looking for help.

The `good first issue` label also indicates that Women Coding Community - London Members have committed to providing extra assistance for newcontributors.

## Code Pattern Guide :memo:
- Use single quotes pattern for simple strings. (Example: `const containerEl = jQuery('#container')` instead of `const containerEl = jQuery("#container")`)
- Define constants that may be used multiple times ahead, and with uppercase variables. Example:
```
const MENTOR_TYPE_BOTH = 'both';

...

if (someValue === MENTOR_TYPE_BOTH) {
    ...
}
```

- Consider defining variables and functions with `const` instead of `let` for declarations that should not change.

## Style Guide for Git Commit Messages :memo:

**How you can add more value to your contribution logs:**

- Use the present tense. (Example: "Add feature" instead of "Added feature")
- Use the imperative mood. (Example: "Move item to...", instead of "Moves item to...")
- Limit the first line (also called the Subject Line) to _50 characters or less_.
- Capitalize the Subject Line.
- Separate subject from body with a blank line.
- Do not end the subject line with a period.
- Wrap the body at _72 characters_.
- Use the body to explain the _what_, _why_, _vs_, and _how_.

## Best practices

- Write clear and meaningful git commit messages.
- If the PR will *completely* fix a specific issue, include `fixes #123` in the PR body (where 123 is the specific issue number the PR will fix. This will automatically close the issue when the PR is merged.
- Make sure you don't include `@mentions` or `fixes` keywords in your git commit messages. These should be included in the PR body instead.
- When you make a PR for small change (such as fixing a typo, style change, or grammar fix), please squash your commits so that we can maintain a cleaner git history.
- Make sure you include a clear and detailed PR description explaining the reasons for the changes, and ensuring there is sufficient information for the reviewer to understand your PR.
