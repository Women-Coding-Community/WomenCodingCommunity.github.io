  bio: |
    I am a dedicated Test Automation Engineer with a passion for ensuring software quality. To me, testing is way more than just identifying bugs and flaws; it’s about viewing processes and products through the lens of the end user. My expertise includes UI test automation, particularly with Playwright, and API test automation using tools like Postman and PactumJS. <br>
    Beyond the technical part, I am interested in exploring different aspects in team communication, cross-cultural collaboration and contributing to professional communities through volunteering. I find immense joy in sharing my insights through articles and engaging in meaningful discussions with peers.<br>
    Moreover, I am eager to help individuals start their journey in software testing. I can share industry knowledge, assist in reviewing your CV, and provide guidance on various related topics.

She built a guild of volunteers to deliver a Mentorship Programme, technical tracks, help with resumes, mock interviews and overall grown community more than triple. As the next step, she will help other networks by holding the position of Senior Director in WWCode. Currently, she works at Revolut and building a platform for retail products. That includes support services to handle our 30 million clients, handle huge throughput and provide law latency for data flow. Irina constantly helps her team to tackle the extra mile and help the company to improve an intervening process, onboarding new hires, navigating interns and running knowledge-sharing activities. As a cherry on top, she helped to launch the inner Revolut Women Guild “RevWomen”. Recently I contributed to my University as a lecturer and designed materials for a course of Software Architecture.

  position: Software Engineer II, Discovery Education
  bio: |
    I started my career in healthcare, but six years ago, I made the switch to software development after completing a bootcamp. It was one of the best decisions I’ve ever made. Since then, I’ve worked as a Software Developer, continuously learning and growing, and now I’m on my way to becoming a Senior Engineer with a strong interest in cybersecurity and software architecture. I love solving complex problems, building secure and scalable applications, and finding ways to improve systems. I thrive in collaborative environments, enjoy sharing what I learn, and always look for ways to make tech more efficient and accessible. To further develop my skills, I completed the Mid-Level Accelerator course with Code First Girls, and I’m currently enrolled in a GenAI bootcamp to understand both the landscape and boundaries of Generative AI. Through this, I’m learning how to critically think, troubleshoot, and build real-world GenAI workloads. One of the most valuable lessons I’ve learned in my tech journey is the power of mentorship and networking—especially as a woman in tech. Early on, I realized that even if we don’t always see many women around us at work, we are not alone. There is a whole community of women who have gone through the same challenges, faced impostor syndrome, and needed support to stay motivated. Seeing this has made me passionate about encouraging more women not just to enter tech, but to stay in the field, find meaning in their work, and recognize the immense value they bring to the table. Outside of work, I’m into hiking, photography, and getting lost in a good book. I also explore topics like digital transformation, organizational psychology, and the intersection of tech and human behavior—it’s fascinating how technology shapes the way we work and interact. My journey into tech was anything but traditional, and I know how challenging (and rewarding) career changes can be. That’s why I love connecting with others who are navigating similar paths and sharing what I’ve learned along the way.

  position: Roboticist, RAI Institute
  bio: |
    I am currently a roboticist/software engineer at the RAI Institute in Boston, MA. At RAI, I work as part of the Robotics API Development Team to build APIs and platforms for our researchers to develop on. I work closely with many of the research teams and am the primary maintainer for our Spot ROS 2 driver and related repositories. Last year, I also had the privilege of presenting our work on this driver at ROSCon 2024. 

    Before RAI, I lived in San Antonio, TX for a few years where I worked as a robotics software engineer at Southwest Research Institute (SwRI). At SwRI, I worked on various industrial automation projects using robots to complete tasks such as sanding, painting, welding, and taking x-rays. I also presented my work at several conferences and was the lead trainer for the ROS-Industrial classes SwRI hosted throughout the year. 

    I completed both my bachelors and masters studies at UC Berkeley in studied electrical engineering and computer science with a focus on robotics and control theory. During my time there, I worked as a student researcher in the Biomimetic Millisystems Lab working on various robotics and controls research projects and was also a TA/GSI for the robotics courses.
