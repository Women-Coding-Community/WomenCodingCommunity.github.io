  bio: |
    I am a dedicated Test Automation Engineer with a passion for ensuring software quality. To me, testing is way more than just identifying bugs and flaws; it’s about viewing processes and products through the lens of the end user. My expertise includes UI test automation, particularly with Playwright, and API test automation using tools like Postman and PactumJS. <br>
    Beyond the technical part, I am interested in exploring different aspects in team communication, cross-cultural collaboration and contributing to professional communities through volunteering. I find immense joy in sharing my insights through articles and engaging in meaningful discussions with peers.<br>
    Moreover, I am eager to help individuals start their journey in software testing. I can share industry knowledge, assist in reviewing your CV, and provide guidance on various related topics.

    Irina is a Director of Women Who Code London and a Senior Backend Software Engineer at Revolut. Her experience as a Software Engineer included working with large projects, search engines, distributed systems, performance issues, and huge data storage. Apart from being a strong developer and a good team player, in the last 3-years, she volunteered for CodeFirst: Girls and Women Who Code London and grew up from volunteer to lead and, in the end, to a Senior Director role within the community. She organised a team to deliver outstanding projects and show impressive results. She built a guild of volunteers to deliver a Mentorship Programme, technical tracks, help with resumes, mock interviews and overall grown community more than triple. As the next step, she will help other networks by holding the position of Senior Director in WWCode. Currently, she works at Revolut and building a platform for retail products. That includes support services to handle our 30 million clients, handle huge throughput and provide law latency for data flow. Irina constantly helps her team to tackle the extra mile and help the company to improve an intervening process, onboarding new hires, navigating interns and running knowledge-sharing activities. As a cherry on top, she helped to launch the inner Revolut Women Guild “RevWomen”. Recently I contributed to my University as a lecturer and designed materials for a course of Software Architecture. This year, I'm connecting different Universities in England with WWCode London to bring more diversity in tech from inspiring the young generation."

  position: Software Engineer II, Discovery Education
  bio: |
    I started my career in healthcare, but six years ago, I made the switch to software development after completing a bootcamp. It was one of the best decisions I’ve ever made. Since then, I’ve worked as a Software Developer, continuously learning and growing, and now I’m on my way to becoming a Senior Engineer with a strong interest in cybersecurity and software architecture. I love solving complex problems, building secure and scalable applications, and finding ways to improve systems. I thrive in collaborative environments, enjoy sharing what I learn, and always look for ways to make tech more efficient and accessible. To further develop my skills, I completed the Mid-Level Accelerator course with Code First Girls, and I’m currently enrolled in a GenAI bootcamp to understand both the landscape and boundaries of Generative AI. Through this, I’m learning how to critically think, troubleshoot, and build real-world GenAI workloads. One of the most valuable lessons I’ve learned in my tech journey is the power of mentorship and networking—especially as a woman in tech. Early on, I realized that even if we don’t always see many women around us at work, we are not alone. There is a whole community of women who have gone through the same challenges, faced impostor syndrome, and needed support to stay motivated. Seeing this has made me passionate about encouraging more women not just to enter tech, but to stay in the field, find meaning in their work, and recognize the immense value they bring to the table. Outside of work, I’m into hiking, photography, and getting lost in a good book. I also explore topics like digital transformation, organizational psychology, and the intersection of tech and human behavior—it’s fascinating how technology shapes the way we work and interact. My journey into tech was anything but traditional, and I know how challenging (and rewarding) career changes can be. That’s why I love connecting with others who are navigating similar paths and sharing what I’ve learned along the way.

  position: Software Engineer, AMScreen
  bio: |
    I am a software engineer with half a decade of professional experience building scalable, production-grade systems across fintech, banking, digital media, and data-driven platforms. My technical background spans backend engineering with C# and .NET, cloud-native architectures on Azure, event-driven microservices, distributed systems, and cross-platform mobile development using Flutter. I’ve worked on systems that support real users at scale, handle sensitive data, and generate revenue, with a strong focus on clean architecture, performance, security, and resilience.
    Beyond delivery, I’ve taken ownership of system design decisions, collaborated closely with product and engineering leaders, and contributed to improving reliability, monitoring, and developer experience. I also hold an MSc in Cybersecurity, which informs my approach to building secure, trustworthy software.
    I’m deeply passionate about mentorship and community impact. I’ve supported career switchers, junior developers, and beginners through one-on-one mentoring, speaking engagements, and community sessions. My goal as a mentor is to help mentees build strong technical foundations, confidence, and clarity in their career paths, while encouraging curiosity, persistence, and continuous learning.

      I am looking for mentees who are curious, open to learning, and willing to show up consistently, regardless of their current skill level. You don’t need to have everything figured out, what matters most is a genuine interest in growing, asking questions, and reflecting on feedback. I particularly enjoy working with early-career developers and career switchers who may be navigating confidence gaps or uncertainty and who want guidance on building strong foundations in both technical skills and professional growth. I value honesty, communication, and a collaborative mindset, and I aim to create a supportive, judgment-free space where mentees feel comfortable making mistakes and learning from them. If you’re motivated to learn, willing to put in the effort, and open to exploring your potential in tech, we’ll work well together.
