    Irina is a Director of Women Who Code London and a Senior Backend Software Engineer at Revolut. Her experience as a Software Engineer included working with large projects, search engines, distributed systems, performance issues, and huge data storage. Apart from being a strong developer and a good team player, in the last 3-years, she volunteered for CodeFirst: Girls and Women Who Code London and grew up from volunteer to lead and, in the end, to a Senior Director role within the community.

She built a guild of volunteers to deliver a Mentorship Programme, technical tracks, help with resumes, mock interviews and overall grown community more than triple. As the next step, she will help other networks by holding the position of Senior Director in WWCode. Currently, she works at Revolut and building a platform for retail products. That includes support services to handle our 30 million clients, handle huge throughput and provide law latency for data flow. Irina constantly helps her team to tackle the extra mile and help the company to improve an intervening process, onboarding new hires, navigating interns and running knowledge-sharing activities. As a cherry on top, she helped to launch the inner Revolut Women Guild “RevWomen”. Recently I contributed to my University as a lecturer and designed materials for a course of Software Architecture. This year, I'm connecting different Universities in England with WWCode London to bring more diversity in tech from inspiring the young generation."

  bio: Hi! My name is Min, I’m a kiwi, and I am a senior Machine Learning / Full-stack Software Engineer of 7 years experience who has worked in a wide range of work environments including a FAANG, a Unicorn, a small startup, and most recently my own startup. From my experience, I’ve seen time and time again how the skewed gender ratio in tech negatively impacts everything we do in tech, and what we build. To combat this, I have mentored with WomenWhoCode before, and I have taught a few courses with CodeFirstGirls before. I would like to continue supporting more women to get into tech industry and moreover succeed in the industry until we have truly achieved gender equality and equity in the tech industry.

  bio: |
    I started my career in healthcare, but six years ago, I made the switch to software development after completing a bootcamp. It was one of the best decisions I’ve ever made. Since then, I’ve worked as a Software Developer, continuously learning and growing, and now I’m on my way to becoming a Senior Engineer with a strong interest in cybersecurity and software architecture. I love solving complex problems, building secure and scalable applications, and finding ways to improve systems. I thrive in collaborative environments, enjoy sharing what I learn, and always look for ways to make tech more efficient and accessible. To further develop my skills, I completed the Mid-Level Accelerator course with Code First Girls, and I’m currently enrolled in a GenAI bootcamp to understand both the landscape and boundaries of Generative AI. Through this, I’m learning how to critically think, troubleshoot, and build real-world GenAI workloads. One of the most valuable lessons I’ve learned in my tech journey is the power of mentorship and networking—especially as a woman in tech. Early on, I realized that even if we don’t always see many women around us at work, we are not alone. There is a whole community of women who have gone through the same challenges, faced impostor syndrome, and needed support to stay motivated. Seeing this has made me passionate about encouraging more women not just to enter tech, but to stay in the field, find meaning in their work, and recognize the immense value they bring to the table. Outside of work, I’m into hiking, photography, and getting lost in a good book. I also explore topics like digital transformation, organizational psychology, and the intersection of tech and human behavior—it’s fascinating how technology shapes the way we work and interact. My journey into tech was anything but traditional, and I know how challenging (and rewarding) career changes can be. That’s why I love connecting with others who are navigating similar paths and sharing what I’ve learned along the way.
