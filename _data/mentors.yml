  bio: Hi! My name is Min, I’m a kiwi, and I am a senior Machine Learning / Full-stack Software Engineer of 7 years experience who has worked in a wide range of work environments including a FAANG, a Unicorn, a small startup, and most recently my own startup. From my experience, I’ve seen time and time again how the skewed gender ratio in tech negatively impacts everything we do in tech, and what we build. To combat this, I have mentored with WomenWhoCode before, and I have taught a few courses with CodeFirstGirls before. I would like to continue supporting more women to get into tech industry and moreover succeed in the industry until we have truly achieved gender equality and equity in the tech industry.

    I've been working as a React developer for around four years and have been working remotely and travelling for the last two. I have a degree in development, but I struggled a lot to find my first job. It was women from a JavaScript community who helped me and guided me to get that first job. It's thanks to them that I am where I am today. So I just want to give a little of this back to the community and help other women get their first job. Even if they already have one but are struggling with situations, impostor syndrome, or solving problems, I can give advice and help with that too.
