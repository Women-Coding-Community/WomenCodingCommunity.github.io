      feedback: Rasim was available anytime I had a concern via slack. We decided to build my app using scrum methodology and I was giving him the feedback every morning on slack. If I had some blockers or couldnâ€™t solve an issue, he had guided me towards how to solve this or where I can find the answer. Rasim was the best mentor I could have, his expertise and experience helped me think better and plan when building something, what to expect in a tech interview, what strategies to adopt when applying for jobs. Also, helped a lot with the CV. He was always available to chat on slack for any issues I had. I am very grateful for having him as my mentor!!!

        I have been mentored by Jyoti for the past 6 months, focusing on preparing for Data Science interviews. Her guidance has been incredibly helpful, she assisted me in improving my resume and LinkedIn profile, which led to more views and better responses from employers.
