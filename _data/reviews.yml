      feedback: Rasim was available anytime I had a concern via slack. We decided to build my app using scrum methodology and I was giving him the feedback every morning on slack. If I had some blockers or couldn’t solve an issue, he had guided me towards how to solve this or where I can find the answer. Rasim was the best mentor I could have, his expertise and experience helped me think better and plan when building something, what to expect in a tech interview, what strategies to adopt when applying for jobs. Also, helped a lot with the CV. He was always available to chat on slack for any issues I had. I am very grateful for having him as my mentor!!!

        I really enjoyed my first experience with a mentor. I had Stephanie as my mentor, and I chose her because of her experience in frontend development and her unique perspective from having changed careers. She's always willing to help, providing valuable resources and advice, and she was always available for a chat when I needed it.

        Stephanie is very knowledgeable about frontend topics and taught me several important aspects to consider when working as a frontend developer that I had never thought about. What I found particularly important was her support when I felt down or less positive. She always encouraged me and made me feel motivated to continue.

        Overall, I think she was a great match for me. I have gained valuable learning from her, and it has been a great experience that contributed significantly to my growth on this journey.

        Adriana is a sensitive, warm, and funny person. She’s the kind of person who asks questions that open your mind and encourage self-reflection, which aligns perfectly with the kind of person I am. 
        She’s always trying to be helpful and offer any kind of support. We’ve navigated many challenges together, such as different time zones, languages, and cultural backgrounds, and I feel our connection has only grown stronger over time. 
        
        In our sessions, we discuss technical matters as well as topics related to work culture, building confidence in your thoughts and ideas, sharing them with your superiors and team, and preventing burnout. 
        I’m grateful to have e-met Adriana during this stage of my learning journey.

        Adriana Zencke Zimmermann is my long-term mentor in the Women Coding Community.

        From our first session, Adriana left an immensely positive impression on me. With an honest and compassionate approach to a person, she generously shares her knowledge and experiences, she is positively oriented with a problem solving attitude, she listens attentively and shows genuine interest in my life situation and aspirations. I have also immediately noticed her exceptional organizational skills, for which I admired her even more.

        During the mentorship, Adriana has helped me in so many ways, improving my technical skills as well as my soft skills, including communication, organization, and presentation. She has helped me gain the confidence I need and has encouraged me to pursue my goals by introducing just the right amount of new tasks and ideas. We also always have time to share life stories and support each other with ideas for improving work-life balance.
        Through Adriana’s mentorship, I have strengthened my expertise in Java, Spring Boot, and API design, which feels fantastic. She guides me through tasks, helps me understand complex parts, and enables me to advance more quickly. I am grateful that she has invited me to collaborate with the WCC team, implementing a new community web platform. Collaborating with others, attending stand-up meetings, and engaging in pair programming have greatly boosted my confidence. My hope is to contribute to future mentorship efforts and help other newcomers grow within the community, just as Adriana has done for me.

        As I have got to know Adriana, I have seen how much heart she puts into the community and people in general. She sees the best in us, she is eager to help, to solve problems and moves us forward. I respect her deeply, and during our conversations, I am always motivated to keep moving forward, take action, and see myself in a positive light.

        The community of wonderful people who generously volunteer their time to help others enter or return to the tech industry, gain knowledge they need, boost their self-esteem and find jobs is like a magic itself and a testament to the greatness of human beings.

        Thank you Adriana and Women Coding Community!
