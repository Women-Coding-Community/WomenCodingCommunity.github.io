      feedback: Rasim was available anytime I had a concern via slack. We decided to build my app using scrum methodology and I was giving him the feedback every morning on slack. If I had some blockers or couldn’t solve an issue, he had guided me towards how to solve this or where I can find the answer. Rasim was the best mentor I could have, his expertise and experience helped me think better and plan when building something, what to expect in a tech interview, what strategies to adopt when applying for jobs. Also, helped a lot with the CV. He was always available to chat on slack for any issues I had. I am very grateful for having him as my mentor!!!

        The WCC mentorship programme has been a turning point in my career journey, and Rajani has been instrumental in that transformation. Coming from 10 years of experience in engineering services in project management support and data analysis (mainly in Excel), I was not from a software development background. After taking a career break to focus on family, my confidence took a dip. Although I completed MS Power BI and PSM1 certifications and began learning Python and SQL, I was not very clear on how to progress and improve my programming skills in the right way.
        Rajani first worked with me to understand my aspirations and challenges. She helped me recognise that many of the personal challenges I perceived were rooted in self-limiting beliefs. She guided me to shift my mindset, build supportive habits, and approach my goals with clarity and confidence. She has a rare gift for getting to the root of a problem with just a few words. A single question from her during our first call completely reframed how I viewed my self-worth after a long break. It was a true breakthrough moment.
        Along with mindset evolution, Rajani provided clear direction in rebuilding my tech foundation. She guided me on strengthening programming and SQL skills through consistent practice, revisiting core CS and DSA concepts, and using resources like LeetCode and CS50 effectively. She also encouraged me to invest in personal branding and networking, both online and in person, to increase visibility with recruiters and the tech community.
        Her mentorship extended into hands-on Agile experience as well. She helped me deepen my understanding of Agile and Scrum, shared practical ways to apply these frameworks, and even gave me the opportunity to practice Scrum in her startup, VisionAriser, which significantly boosted my confidence and leadership skills.
        Rajani has changed the way I see myself, how I respond to challenges, and how I approach both life and career. Her blend of empathy, sharp insight, and actionable guidance makes her a powerful mentor who truly accelerates growth.
        I am deeply grateful to Rajani and to WCC for creating such an empowering space. This community helped me believe that returning to work was not only possible, but that I could excel and build a meaningful career ahead.

        Adriana Zencke Zimmermann is my long-term mentor in the Women Coding Community.

        From our first session, Adriana left an immensely positive impression on me. With an honest and compassionate approach to a person, she generously shares her knowledge and experiences, she is positively oriented with a problem solving attitude, she listens attentively and shows genuine interest in my life situation and aspirations. I have also immediately noticed her exceptional organizational skills, for which I admired her even more.

        During the mentorship, Adriana has helped me in so many ways, improving my technical skills as well as my soft skills, including communication, organization, and presentation. She has helped me gain the confidence I need and has encouraged me to pursue my goals by introducing just the right amount of new tasks and ideas. We also always have time to share life stories and support each other with ideas for improving work-life balance.
        Through Adriana’s mentorship, I have strengthened my expertise in Java, Spring Boot, and API design, which feels fantastic. She guides me through tasks, helps me understand complex parts, and enables me to advance more quickly. I am grateful that she has invited me to collaborate with the WCC team, implementing a new community web platform. Collaborating with others, attending stand-up meetings, and engaging in pair programming have greatly boosted my confidence. My hope is to contribute to future mentorship efforts and help other newcomers grow within the community, just as Adriana has done for me.

        As I have got to know Adriana, I have seen how much heart she puts into the community and people in general. She sees the best in us, she is eager to help, to solve problems and moves us forward. I respect her deeply, and during our conversations, I am always motivated to keep moving forward, take action, and see myself in a positive light.

        The community of wonderful people who generously volunteer their time to help others enter or return to the tech industry, gain knowledge they need, boost their self-esteem and find jobs is like a magic itself and a testament to the greatness of human beings.

She offered insights that boosted my confidence and helped me see how one particular path could lead to meaningful professional growth. Where I had doubts, she was motivating and reassuring, and her guidance gave me a clearer vision of what I could achieve. I'm truly grateful for her support and the positive impact it's had on both my mindset and my career planning.

        Madhura was absolutely fantastic! I reached out to her for a mock interview session and she was very accomodating and flexible despite the tight timeline. 
        Not only did she request for more details on the interview format and the company so she could adequately prepare ahead, she also helped with getting more tips/advice from a technical interviewer on what they'd look out for in candidates. 
        The session was very insightful and she shared so many tips on what I should focus on and that I had the skills/knowledge, I just needed to showcase it from a product-mindset, security-conscious, mid-level engineer perspective. 
        100% recommend her! Thank you for accommodating me on such short notice!

        It was an amazing 45-minute session. I feel much more motivated to transition from a Data Analyst to a Data Scientist.
        It was also truly valuable to connect with someone like Busra who understands clearly the unique challenges of an international working in data science in the UK.
        She asked critical questions to understand my profile and then suggested very clear next steps on learning materials, job search portals, and CV improvement.
        She even offered me some mock interviews in the future. I highly appreciate her great support and dedication!

        This mentor is amazing. She regularly meets with me and has created a curriculum that really helps me

        has accordingly adjusted the pace which I really appreciate it. I also love the style of having mock interviews to

        My session with Mr Wilson was deeply impactful both personally and professionally. He helped me realize that I don’t need to overwhelm myself trying to figure everything out at once especially with something as broad and deep as front-end development and JavaScript. Instead, he emphasized the importance of pacing myself, building momentum through small, consistent efforts. That really shifted my mindset.
        He also challenged me to think beyond just attending bootcamps and ticking boxes. It’s not just about showing up it’s about what I do after. He encouraged me to find an accountability partner, someone who can support me when I get stuck or feel unmotivated. That simple suggestion made the journey feel more human and less isolating.
        Overall, Wilson’s guidance gave me a clearer structure and deeper confidence to grow intentionally, not just professionally, but personally in how I handle procrastination, discipline, and self-worth as I build my career. He was very comfortable speaking with.

I particularly valued her emphasis on letting go of fear and pressure in order to make clear, values-aligned career decisions; guidance that was both empowering and actionable.
        Her advice on exploring alternative career paths was insightful, especially around identifying short-term income opportunities for stability while pursuing long-term goals. She also encouraged engaging with tech communities, leveraging existing skills in new ways, contributing to open-source projects, and asking more intentional questions. I left the session feeling more focused, confident, and motivated to move forward with purpose.
