      feedback: Rasim was available anytime I had a concern via slack. We decided to build my app using scrum methodology and I was giving him the feedback every morning on slack. If I had some blockers or couldnâ€™t solve an issue, he had guided me towards how to solve this or where I can find the answer. Rasim was the best mentor I could have, his expertise and experience helped me think better and plan when building something, what to expect in a tech interview, what strategies to adopt when applying for jobs. Also, helped a lot with the CV. He was always available to chat on slack for any issues I had. I am very grateful for having him as my mentor!!!

        I really enjoyed my first experience with a mentor. I had Stephanie as my mentor, and I chose her because of her experience in frontend development and her unique perspective from having changed careers. She's always willing to help, providing valuable resources and advice, and she was always available for a chat when I needed it.

        Stephanie is very knowledgeable about frontend topics and taught me several important aspects to consider when working as a frontend developer that I had never thought about. What I found particularly important was her support when I felt down or less positive. She always encouraged me and made me feel motivated to continue.

        Overall, I think she was a great match for me. I have gained valuable learning from her, and it has been a great experience that contributed significantly to my growth on this journey.
