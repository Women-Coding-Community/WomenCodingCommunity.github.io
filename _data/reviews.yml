      feedback: Rasim was available anytime I had a concern via slack. We decided to build my app using scrum methodology and I was giving him the feedback every morning on slack. If I had some blockers or couldn’t solve an issue, he had guided me towards how to solve this or where I can find the answer. Rasim was the best mentor I could have, his expertise and experience helped me think better and plan when building something, what to expect in a tech interview, what strategies to adopt when applying for jobs. Also, helped a lot with the CV. He was always available to chat on slack for any issues I had. I am very grateful for having him as my mentor!!!

        Adriana Zencke Zimmermann is my long-term mentor in the Women Coding Community.

        From our first session, Adriana left an immensely positive impression on me. With an honest and compassionate approach to a person, she generously shares her knowledge and experiences, she is positively oriented with a problem solving attitude, she listens attentively and shows genuine interest in my life situation and aspirations. I have also immediately noticed her exceptional organizational skills, for which I admired her even more.

        During the mentorship, Adriana has helped me in so many ways, improving my technical skills as well as my soft skills, including communication, organization, and presentation. She has helped me gain the confidence I need and has encouraged me to pursue my goals by introducing just the right amount of new tasks and ideas. We also always have time to share life stories and support each other with ideas for improving work-life balance.
        Through Adriana’s mentorship, I have strengthened my expertise in Java, Spring Boot, and API design, which feels fantastic. She guides me through tasks, helps me understand complex parts, and enables me to advance more quickly. I am grateful that she has invited me to collaborate with the WCC team, implementing a new community web platform. Collaborating with others, attending stand-up meetings, and engaging in pair programming have greatly boosted my confidence. My hope is to contribute to future mentorship efforts and help other newcomers grow within the community, just as Adriana has done for me.

        As I have got to know Adriana, I have seen how much heart she puts into the community and people in general. She sees the best in us, she is eager to help, to solve problems and moves us forward. I respect her deeply, and during our conversations, I am always motivated to keep moving forward, take action, and see myself in a positive light.

        The community of wonderful people who generously volunteer their time to help others enter or return to the tech industry, gain knowledge they need, boost their self-esteem and find jobs is like a magic itself and a testament to the greatness of human beings.

        Thank you Adriana and Women Coding Community!

        My session with Mr Wilson was deeply impactful both personally and professionally. He helped me realize that I don’t need to overwhelm myself trying to figure everything out at once especially with something as broad and deep as front-end development and JavaScript. Instead, he emphasized the importance of pacing myself, building momentum through small, consistent efforts. That really shifted my mindset.
        He also challenged me to think beyond just attending bootcamps and ticking boxes. It’s not just about showing up it’s about what I do after. He encouraged me to find an accountability partner, someone who can support me when I get stuck or feel unmotivated. That simple suggestion made the journey feel more human and less isolating.
        Overall, Wilson’s guidance gave me a clearer structure and deeper confidence to grow intentionally, not just professionally, but personally in how I handle procrastination, discipline, and self-worth as I build my career. He was very comfortable speaking with.

        My conversation with Sonika provided much-needed clarity and helped me pinpoint key areas to focus on as I navigate my next steps. I particularly valued her emphasis on letting go of fear and pressure in order to make clear, values-aligned career decisions; guidance that was both empowering and actionable.
        Her advice on exploring alternative career paths was insightful, especially around identifying short-term income opportunities for stability while pursuing long-term goals. She also encouraged engaging with tech communities, leveraging existing skills in new ways, contributing to open-source projects, and asking more intentional questions. I left the session feeling more focused, confident, and motivated to move forward with purpose.
        Sonika is a clear and supportive mentor who helped me refocus and gain direction. Her practical, values-based guidance and tailored suggestions like balancing immediate needs with long-term goals and tapping into existing strengths left me feeling confident and motivated to take meaningful next steps.

        Samuela was not only thoughtful and caring but also very honest and insightful throughout the session. I was able to learn more about what it's like to work in start up/scale up companies based on her experience and how would I be able to stand out among other candidates by letting me know what and how to highlight my experience on my CV.
        Also, it was nice to share some worries as a woman in tech and hear really good advice and suggestions that would make a huge difference to my mindset and mental health. Overall, it was a comfortable yet therapeutic session and I really enjoyed it.

        She was able to give advice on how to tackle the tech industry job application as an soon-to-be graduate student.
        She was also able to get me connected to an individual working in a particular sector that I was really interested in.
