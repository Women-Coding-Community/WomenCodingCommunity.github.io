## Event 1\n\nTitle: Build Better Flows, Reduce Bugs, Think Like a Product Person\n\nDescription: Understanding user journeys is one of the most powerful skills you can develop  whether you’re a software developer, a future Product Manager, or someone transitioning into tech.  In this hands-on workshop, we’ll map a real product flow step-by-step and explore how clear journeys improve development speed, reduce bugs, and create better user experiences.  You will learn:   What a user journey really is  Happy path vs. edge cases (and why both matter)  Common mistakes in product flows  How journeys shape API needs, validations and error handling  How clearer journeys improve communication between devs, PMs, and designers  A live exercise: building the Password Reset flow together  Who should come:  No product background required  just curiosity. Perfect for developers, PM candidates, designers, and career switchers who want to strengthen their product thinking.
