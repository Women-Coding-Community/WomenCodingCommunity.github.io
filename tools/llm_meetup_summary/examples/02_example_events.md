Beyond learning new skills or processes, the transition often triggers a deeper internal struggle - an identity shift that reshapes how they see their value, their work, and themselves.  In this fireside chat, Meena draws from her newly published book, The Engineer Who Became a Manager, to explore the rarely discussed psychological journey of moving from individual contributor to engineering leader. Together, we’ll unpack why the transition feels so disorienting, why common management training often falls short, and why many new managers quietly question whether they’ve made the right choice.  Rather than focusing on frameworks or tactics, this conversation goes beneath the surface to examine the loss of technical identity, the emotional weight of leadership, and the search for meaning that accompanies this career shift.  Expect an honest, thoughtful discussion that validates the experience many engineering managers have but rarely articulate.   Date: 28th Jan 2026  Time: 7:00 PM BST  Who should attend   First-time engineering managers  Senior engineers considering a management path  Leaders and mentors supporting engineers through career transitions  What you’ll gain   A clearer understanding of the identity shift behind the manager transition  Make sense of the emotional challenges  Language to make sense of common struggles new managers face  A more grounded perspective on leadership beyond technical expertise  Speaker: Meena Venkataraman  LinkedIn  Founder of Code to Leadership, inspired by watching too many brilliant engineers struggle not with competence, but with identity, during the transition into management.  With over 20 years of experience working with technology teams and leaders, she brings a rare blend of technical context, leadership insight, and deep empathy for first-time managers.  An ICF-credentialed coach, Meena works closely with new engineering managers to help them develop leadership approaches that are sustainable, human, and true to who they are, rather than forcing them into one-size-fits-all management models.  The Engineer Who Became a Manager is her first book, exploring the often unspoken psychological journey engineers face when stepping into leadership roles.

In practice, software can run on green power and still waste energy through idle compute, over allocation, and inefficient design choices. This session reframes Green IT as an engineering discipline: reduce waste through concrete, repeatable actions and use CO2 as validation rather than the primary steering mechanism.  You will be introduced to DevOps, a practical framework that embeds sustainability into the daily work of DevOps teams by integrating measurable sustainability actions directly into the delivery lifecycle. We will walk through the DevOps playbook: Detect, Expose, Fix, Validate. You will see how observability and AI can surface inefficiencies, how testing can make sustainability signals visible earlier, how pipelines can automate improvements in code and infrastructure as code, and how Ops and FinOps can validate outcomes using energy, emissions, cost, and performance. Attendees will leave with a clear, end to end approach to turn sustainability ambition into operational habits and measurable impact.   Speaker: Wilco Burggraaf, Sustainable Digital Architect  Transformation Lead  LinkedIn Wilco Burggraaf is the Principal Lead of Green Software Engineering at HighTech Innovators, based in Rijen, The Netherlands.
