  bio: |
    I am a mother, a wife, and a Software Engineer. I graduated in Computer Science and have over 14 years of experience working in tech companies in Brazil, Germany, and Spain. As Backend Engineer, I found this to be my passion which I focused on in the last six years of my career. I am always excited to help others, and my goal is to empower women and support them with the difficulties I had as an engineer, and I still have from time to time.
