  <p>In the land where I was born, there's a saying that resonates deeply with the essence of female solidarity:</p>
  <p>This timeless wisdom reflects the innate empathy and support that women naturally extend to one another through life's challenges.</p>

    <p>Lately, I've been reflecting on this age-old adage, especially in the context of my role as an evangelist for the <strong>Women Coding Community (WCC)</strong>. Built on principles of unity, empowerment, and inclusivity, the WCC serves as a beacon of hope for women navigating the predominantly male-dominated tech industry.</p>
    <p>
      Similar to many sectors, the tech industry grapples with gender inequality. Recent statistics reveal a concerning reality: only about 5% of tech professionals are women, according to data from 
      <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1126823/worldwide-developer-gender/" target="_blank">Statista.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      Additionally, research on 
      <a href="https://explodingtopics.com/blog/women-in-tech" target="_blank">Exploding Topics</a>
      shows that women constitute just 26.2% of the workforce in large corporations with over 10,000 employees.
    </p>
    <p>Despite these challenges, <strong>Women Coding Community</strong> emerges as a catalyst for change. Led by a dedicated team in London, this global community welcomes women from all backgrounds, including seasoned professionals, aspiring newcomers, and individuals exploring career transitions.</p>

    <p><strong>Women Coding Community</strong> stands out for its commitment to nurturing a supportive and collaborative environment. As an evangelist for the community, I've witnessed firsthand how remarkable women come together within this space, offering guidance, mentorship, and encouragement to one another. The result is a vibrant and inclusive community where every voice is valued and respected.</p>
    <p>If you're just starting to learn to code, thinking about changing jobs, or already have experience and want to connect with others, the WCC is here to help you grow. You'll find lots of support, resources, and chances to learn new things and improve your skills.</p>
    <p>All together, let's continue our journey towards empowerment, solidarity, and progress. May our collective efforts pave the way for a brighter and more equitable future for women in tech.</p>
