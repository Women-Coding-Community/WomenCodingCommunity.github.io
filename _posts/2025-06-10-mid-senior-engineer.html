  and to reach that coveted "Senior Engineer" status is bubbling beneath the surface. You're
  not alone! The journey from Mid to Senior is a significant step in any tech professional's

    I suggest to look at two strategies following the chart:

    <b>Path 1: Get a promotion within your company </b>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Goal: </b>Get a promotion within your company. </li>
    <li><b>Plan:</b></li>
  </ul>
  <ol>

    <b>
      <li> Align your goal with your manager.</li>
    </b>
    <p>
      This is the first and the most crucial step. Unless you come to the person who is responsible for your promotion
      and ask for it there's no sense in preparing a plan with steps, enrolling in certifications for promotions, and
      getting more projects on the plate without any advice.
    </p>

    <b>
      <li> Set up exact steps with your manager.</li>
    </b>
    <p>
      From the first step, you should learn what you need to do: where your gaps are, where your strengths are, where
      your weaknesses are.
    </p>

    <b>
      <li>Execute those steps</li>
    </b>
    <p>User SMART technique for each step. </p>

    <b>
      <li>Ensure recognition across teams.</li>
    </b>
    <p>It's crucial for promotion to be visible inside your company. The more you help others, the more scope you touch
      and your knowledge increases. </p>

    <b>
      <li>Work for the review & feedback. </li>
    </b>
    <p>The important point is to know exact dates where reviews and promotion windows inside your company are happening.
      Your review date is your hard deadline.
      <b> ● Outcome (if your goal is not yet achieved): </b>
    </p>
  </ol>

  <br>
  <ol>
    <div>
      <b>
        <li>Gather the feedback and create an actionable plan from it to close gaps.</li>
      </b>
      All those steps gave you an amazing experience. How could you do better? What is left for the next time? Through
      several iterations you're guaranteed to get the promotion. However, it could be from 2 to 5 iterations with a
      feedback loop.
    </div>

    <b>
      <li>Go from 1 to 5 from the previous block again.</li>
    </b>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Outcome (if your goal is achieved):</b> Promotion to Senior Engineer. </li>
    </ul>
    <b>Pass the Interview to obtain the Senior position </b>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Goal:</b>Pass the Interview to obtain the Senior position.
      </li>
      <li><b>Plan:</b>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Apply for the interview.
          </li>
          <li>
            Ask HR what stages and how to prepare; ask for feedback in advance.
          </li>
          <li>
            Prepare for the interview.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><b>Possible Outcomes:</b>
         <ul>
          <li>
            Obtain the role in a company with a quicker feedback loop and get the promotion there. 
          </li>
          <li>
             Analyse the feedback and apply for the next interview. (This outcome loops back to the "Plan" stage for passing the interview). 
          </li>
          <li>
            …and, of course, obtain the role of Senior Engineer! 
          </li>
          </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>

  </ol>

    A couple of months ago, shortly after I released my fourth solo mobile game project on the Google Play Store, I
    texted an old coworker of mine. He replied, “Oh, I didn’t know you were also a developer!” And I immediately tried
    to convince him that I wasn’t. “I’m not a developer! I just… make games in my spare time. I learned it myself, but I
    have so many things I don’t know. So, I’m not a developer,” I said, almost defensively. And he said, “Well, I’ve
    never released any games, so there’s a lot you know that I don’t, and a lot I know that you don’t.” And that
    conversation bugged me for a while. What makes a person a developer? Certainly I, an English major, couldn’t be one.
    But I wanted to prove to myself why that was so.
  </p>

  <p>
    After thinking long and hard about my excuses, and carefully separating myself from people who are “developers”, I
    came to the conclusion that I had lots of gaps in the most basic things that any “developer” would know
    instinctively. The thing is, I knew some of the terms I didn’t understand, but the biggest problem was that I didn’t
    even know what I didn’t know. And that’s when I decided to join the mentorship program at Women Coding Community. In
    our first session, Rajani successfully identified my gaps and suggested how I could improve them. She also told me
    how important it was that I already had complete projects. She gave me what I couldn’t give myself - an honest,
    experienced outside perspective. I had always been extremely self-critical, always focusing on what I lacked. With
    her help, I managed to just stop and look at how far I’ve come, and appreciate the things I’ve accomplished. She
    suggested that I take an algorithms and data structures course, which I did from various free online sources, and I
    already feel much more comfortable.

    Now, the great question: should you follow both paths simultaneously? It's up to you, however, the balanced model
    will be to go through Path 1 for a year and if you've not succeeded go through Path 2 for the next year. The
    iterative approach will lead you to the goal. However, the common trap for engineers is to try to do both paths at
    the same time and it leads to burnout. One path can be the background while the other is the focus. Regular
    interviews wouldn't hurt but be mindful of your time and remember that they were in the background path when you've
    got a rejection.
    I wish you the best of luck on your way!
