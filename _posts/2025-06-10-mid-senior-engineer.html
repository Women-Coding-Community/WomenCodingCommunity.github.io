  Engineer" title feels comfortable. But the ambition to grow, to take on more responsibility,
  and to reach that coveted "Senior Engineer" status is bubbling beneath the surface. You're
  not alone! The journey from Mid to Senior is a significant step in any tech professional's

    I suggest to look at two strategies following the chart:

  <p>
    <b>Path 1: Get a promotion within your company </b>
  <ul>
    <b>Goal: </b>Get a promotion within your company.
  </ul>
    <p><b>Plan:</b></p>
  <ol>

    <b>
      <li> Align your goal with your manager.</li>
    </b>
    <p>
      This is the first and the most crucial step. Unless you come to the person who is responsible for your promotion
      and ask for it there's no sense in preparing a plan with steps, enrolling in certifications for promotions, and
      getting more projects on the plate without any advice.
    </p>

    <b>
      <li> Set up exact steps with your manager.</li>
    </b>
    <p>
      From the first step, you should learn what you need to do: where your gaps are, where your strengths are, where
      your weaknesses are.
    </p>

    <b>
      <li>Execute those steps</li>
    </b>
    <p>User SMART technique for each step. </p>

    <b>
      <li>Ensure recognition across teams.</li>
    </b>
    <p>It's crucial for promotion to be visible inside your company. The more you help others, the more scope you touch
      and your knowledge increases. </p>

    <b>
      <li>Work for the review & feedback. </li>
    </b>
    <p>The important point is to know exact dates where reviews and promotion windows inside your company are happening.
      Your review date is your hard deadline.
    </p>
  </ol>
      <b>  Outcome (if your goal is not yet achieved): </b>

  <br>
  <ol>
    <div>
      <b>
        <li>Gather the feedback and create an actionable plan from it to close gaps.</li>
      </b>
      All those steps gave you an amazing experience. How could you do better? What is left for the next time? Through
      several iterations you're guaranteed to get the promotion. However, it could be from 2 to 5 iterations with a
      feedback loop.
    </div>

    <b>
      <li>Go from 1 to 5 from the previous block again.</li>
    </b>
      </ol>

      <p> <b>Outcome (if your goal is achieved):</b> Promotion to Senior Engineer. </p>
     <b>Pass the Interview to obtain the Senior position </b>
    <ul>
     <b>Goal:</b>Pass the Interview to obtain the Senior position.
      <li><b>Plan:</b>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Apply for the interview.
          </li>
          <li>
            Ask HR what stages and how to prepare; ask for feedback in advance.
          </li>
          <li>
            Prepare for the interview.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><b>Possible Outcomes:</b>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Obtain the role in a company with a quicker feedback loop and get the promotion there.
          </li>
          <li>
            Analyse the feedback and apply for the next interview. (This outcome loops back to the "Plan" stage for
            passing the interview).
          </li>
          <li>
            …and, of course, obtain the role of Senior Engineer!
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>


  <p>
    Now, the great question: should you follow both paths simultaneously? It's up to you, however, the balanced model
    will be to go through Path 1 for a year and if you've not succeeded go through Path 2 for the next year. The
    iterative approach will lead you to the goal. However, the common trap for engineers is to try to do both paths at
    the same time and it leads to burnout. One path can be the background while the other is the focus. Regular
    interviews wouldn't hurt but be mindful of your time and remember that they were in the background path when you've
    got a rejection.
    I wish you the best of luck on your way!
