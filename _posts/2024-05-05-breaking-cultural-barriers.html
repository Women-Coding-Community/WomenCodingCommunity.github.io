    In this blog we explore breaking cultural barriers to start a tech career

<div>
    <p>Growing up, I felt boxed in by Asian society's rules. It seemed like I had to follow a certain path just because I was a girl. But then came a glimmer of hope: the opportunity to go to University. That was my ticket to breaking free from those expectations and finding my own path.</p>
    <p>Despite the odds, I convinced my family to let me go to university, sparking the ambition in me. But after graduation, societal pressures hit me hard again. Everyone seemed more concerned about my marital status than my aspirations. So, to keep my family's honour, I rushed into marriage, hoping I could still find my own way.</p>
    <p>Grappling with traditional expectations from in-laws and now being married, I succeeded in landing a job in the tech industry, bringing me some kind of hope for my career. However, just a year into my job, I received the news of my pregnancy. When I asked to return to work part-time after my maternity leave, my request was gently declined, leaving me feeling disheartened. Despite my disappointment, I continued to search for part-time tech opportunities.</p>
    <p>However, after months of trying with no success, I eventually made the difficult decision to let go of my tech career aspirations, particularly as I found out I was pregnant once again. As an Asian wife, societal norms emphasized my role in managing the household, caring for the children, and attending to domestic responsibilities. Balancing these duties left me with little energy to ponder my future or career path.</p>
    <p>With a blink of an eye and fast forward my life 14 years, I had now 4 kids and suddenly, everything seemed to revolve around the needs of my growing family. The dreams and aspirations I once held dear faded into the background as I embraced the role of motherhood and wife.</p>
    <p>Slowly but surely, I began to lose sight of who I was beneath the layers of responsibility. It was like I was on autopilot, just going through the motion’s day in and day out. The spark of ambition that once burned brightly within me was dimmed by the constant reminder that my primary duty was to be the perfect caregiver and homemaker.</p>
    <p>In conforming to these societal expectations, I found myself drifting further away from my true self. My career in tech to be seemed like a distant memory, overshadowed by the demands of family life.</p>
    <p>There was a time when I felt lost and unsure of myself. It was like I was stuck in the dark, unable to find my way. But then, my eldest brother came to my rescue. He saw the struggles I was going through and made it his mission to help me find my way back to the light. With his support, I started to feel hopeful again.</p>

    <p>I also started to think differently and stumbled upon podcasts where women had made differences in tech/coding and self-help books, which slowly shifted my perspective. Feeling more aware, I made small changes like going for walks, joining a gym, and rediscovering the joy of riding my bike from childhood. These simple actions brought renewal and inspiration to my life, showing me the power of embracing change and finding joy in everyday experiences.</p>
    <p>The more I heard about women making their mark in tech, the stronger my sense of determination grew and then I stumbled upon inspiring stories on social media about mothers and older women changing careers. It got me thinking about my own path, so I started looking into courses.</p>

    <p>Before long, I found myself diving into a Full Stack developer bootcamp. It was a game-changer. Coding made me feel alive again. It wasn't just about learning a new skill—it was about reclaiming a part of myself that I had lost. </p>
    <p>The more I coded, the more my confidence grew. Coding empowered me in ways I never imagined. It reminded me that it's never too late to pursue our passions and shape our own futures.</p>
    <p>After finishing my bootcamp, I eagerly started my job search, only to face disappointment. But instead of feeling defeated, I decided to change my perspective.</p>
    <p>With over 15 years of no corporate experience, I realised that I could aim for roles where it allows me to learn tech in general and have some kind code aspects as well.</p>
    <p>This shift in thinking opened new opportunities for me. Instead of focusing solely on software developer roles, I started looking for positions where I could gain exposure to coding and other tech areas.</p>
    <p>After an extensive search for career opportunities, an agency sent me a link to a role at Network Rail that immediately caught my attention. Although the role wasn’t a software developer, it presented a unique blend of responsibilities that excited me, and it mentioned managing intranet sites which I felt would have some kind of development aspect in it. </p>

    <p>While my current position isn't solely focused on software development, I still have the opportunity to work with TypeScript, React, JavaScript, and JSON using SharePoint framework. Recently, I've been entrusted with the exciting project of re-developing our department’s entire SharePoint Intranet site.</p>
    <p>From creating wireframes and prototypes to overseeing the entire project, I'm responsible for every aspect. It's an incredible opportunity, and I'm thoroughly enjoying every moment of it.</p>
    <p>As an older woman diving into the world of tech/software development, I often feel the weight of time pressing down on me as I am getting older. It's easy to get caught up in the rush to achieve more, but my mentor's advice to take things "one step at a time" resonates deeply. I've come to realize that the journey is just as important as the destination. There are days when the energy levels aren't quite what they were in my 20s or 30s, especially with the challenges of perimenopause. Despite this, I strive to appreciate the journey and find joy in learning.</p>
