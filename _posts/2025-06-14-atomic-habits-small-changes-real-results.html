    There was a time when I believed that the missing piece was motivation. I thought I just needed to try harder, stay more disciplined, push through resistance. But I’d often find myself slipping back into old routines—scrolling too long, skipping workouts, postponing personal projects. It wasn’t until I read Atomic Habits by James Clear that I realized: it’s not about willpower. It’s about systems.
  </p>

  <p>
    Clear’s book doesn’t promise transformation overnight. Instead, it builds the case for something far more powerful—consistent, tiny improvements that compound over time. The idea is simple: if you get just 1% better each day, you will end up roughly 38 times better in one year. One small habit, repeated daily, can lead to major life shifts. Conversely, a 1% decline every day diminishes almost to zero. This is why tiny habits matter so much.
  </p>

  <div class="container">
    <br>
    <div class="text-center">
      1.01<sup>(365)</sup> = 37.78 → That’s 38x better in a year.
    </div>
    <br>
    <div class="text-center">
      0.99<sup>(365)</sup> = 0.03 → That’s almost nothing left.
    </div>
    <br>
  </div>

  <p>
    What really resonated with me was the concept of identity-based change. We often set goals like “get fit” or “become productive,” but we rarely stop to consider who we’re trying to become in the process. Clear flips the usual goal-setting approach on its head: instead of focusing on the outcome, focus on the identity behind it. Don’t just say you want to run more—see yourself as a runner. Don’t just try to write more—become a writer. That subtle mindset shift—from <b><i>outcome</i> to <i>identity</i></b>—makes all the difference.
  </p>

  <p>
    When I started applying this to my own life, I saw it instantly. Instead of vaguely trying to “improve as a data scientist,” I asked myself: what does a great data scientist do daily? They study, they build, they learn from feedback, they stay curious. So I began doing those things, even if only for a few minutes. And slowly, it became part of who I am, not just something I try to squeeze in when I’m feeling motivated.
  </p>

  <p>
    One of the most useful strategies from the book is creating what Clear calls a “Habits Scorecard.” It’s simple—write down the actions you take each day and label them as good, bad, or neutral. What this does is build awareness. Because the truth is, many of our habits run on autopilot. And if a habit stays unconscious, we have no chance of improving it. Noticing what we do is the first step toward choosing something different.
  </p>

  <p>
    Another powerful concept is the idea of implementation intentions. It’s not enough to say “I’ll read more” or “I’ll meditate.” That kind of open-ended intention rarely works. But something like “I’ll read for ten minutes at 9 PM in my bedroom” has structure. It gives your brain a specific plan to follow. I started applying this to my own routines, and now I don’t go to sleep if I don’t read for at least 10 minutes.
  </p>

  <p>
    What makes these habits stick, though, is context. Our environment shapes our behavior far more than we realize. If your guitar is buried in the closet, chances are you won’t play it. If your phone is right next to you while you’re trying to focus, you’ll probably pick it up. I’ve learned to rearrange my surroundings to make the right actions easier to start—and the wrong ones harder to reach. It’s not about forcing yourself to do better. It’s about removing the need to fight in the first place.
  </p>

  <p>
    Clear also touches on something called temptation bundling—pairing something you need to do with something you want to do. For example, I now listen to my favorite podcast only when I’m at the gym. That little trick turns effort into enjoyment, and it helps the habit reinforce itself. It’s a small tweak, but a powerful one.
  </p>

  <p>
    Separately, this connects to the ‘Habit Stacking’ principle: adding a new habit immediately after an existing one you already do reliably. For example, if you already make a cup of coffee every morning, you can spend the next 10 minutes reading a new data science article right after. This technique makes it even easier to adopt new habits for data people.
  </p>

  <p>
    The neuroscience behind habits is equally fascinating. The more we repeat an action, the more efficient our brain becomes at performing it. That’s why showing up—even for just one minute—matters so much. Perfection isn’t required. Repetition is. Each time you do the habit, you reinforce the neural pathway that makes it easier to do again tomorrow.
  </p>

  <p>
    And when things go off track—as they inevitably will—the most important rule is simple: never miss twice. Everyone skips a day. Everyone breaks the chain. But the difference between a lapse and a reversal is whether we get back on track immediately. The first miss doesn’t break you. The second one is what turns it into a pattern. A small trick to avoid skipping days in a row is to ‘reduce the barrier’ after a miss. If you miss a workout, commit to doing just 5 minutes the next day. This tiny step prevents a second miss and reaffirms your identity.
  </p>

  <p>
    More than anything, Atomic Habits taught me that lasting change isn’t about intensity—it’s about consistency. You don’t need a breakthrough. You need a system that carries you forward even when motivation fades. Start with something small. Tie it to who you want to become. And then keep showing up.
  </p>

  <p>
    Because every action you take is a quiet vote for the kind of person you want to be.
  </p>

  <p>
    One last question for you: I know who I want to become. Do you?
