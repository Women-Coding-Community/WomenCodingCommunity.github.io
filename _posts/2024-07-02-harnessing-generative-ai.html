    Generative AI, a transformative technology, has seen rapid advancements and widespread adoption in recent years.
  </p>  
  <p>
    Major tech companies and startups are in a competitive race to develop superior models, while businesses and governments explore its applications and implications My journey with GenAI began with a Hackathon for Social Good, creating Anxi-Aid, a tool utilizing AI for personalized anxiety management plans. This blogpost highlighted the potential of Generative AI in enhancing lives. To harness this technology, I walk through how one needs to understand use case, master prompt engineering, and leverage existing tools like OpenAI’s API.

    Generative AI has captured global attention this year. Over the past two years, we've seen a competitive race among big tech companies and startups, each striving to develop models that outperform the others. Meanwhile, numerous businesses are adopting Generative AI to enhance their operations, and governments are crafting policies to safeguard public interests and regulate the transformative impacts of this technology.
  </p>
  <p>
    What is Generative AI? Generative AI refers to a category of artificial intelligence technologies designed to create new content — ranging from text and images to music and code — based on the patterns and information it has learned from training data.
  </p>
  <p>
    What is its future? This technology is set to continue its disruptive trajectory.
  </p>
  <p>
    Why should we care? By understanding how to leverage Generative AI, we can harness these tools for our betterment. By trailblazing and adapting, I believe we can not only unlock its full potential but also identify and effectively communicate its blind spots.
  </p>
  <p>
    My personal journey with leveraging Generative AI began when I participated in a Hackathon for Social Good organized by Women Who Code. <a href="#my-project">My project<sup id="fn1">1.</sup></a>, Anxi-Aid, showcases how Generative AI, specifically text generation models, can be utilized to manage anxiety. This tool is designed to assist therapists in creating personalized plans for their patients. Although still in its developmental stages, Anxi-Aid was a revelation, offering me a glimpse into the vast potential of these technologies. It also underscored the power of embracing technology to lead advancements in fields that could significantly improve lives. I used it quite a bit to manage my stress and it is helping me.

    If you are interested in using GenAI for your own use case and have a basic understanding of a programming language, you are just three steps away from seeing results:
  </p>
  <p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>1. Know Your Use Case: </b>Understanding why will help determine which type of Generative model you need. Options include text generation, image generation, and speech generation.
      </li>
      <li><b>2. Master Prompt Engineering: </b> The adage 'the quality of your questions determines the quality of your answers' holds true in the context of AI. Learning how to effectively frame your queries can significantly influence the relevance and utility of the responses you receive from these models. I highly recommend the high-quality, free, beginner-friendly course by <a target="_blank" href="https://www.deeplearning.ai/short-courses/chatgpt-prompt-engineering-for-developers">DeepLearning</a>. AI on ChatGPT Prompt Engineering for Developers to learn more about this. 
      </li>
      <li><b>3. Leverage Tools by Existing Players:</b> Utilizing Large Language Models like Chat-GPT is straightforward if you have some programming knowledge and are willing to invest a modest fee. For instance, <a target="_blank" href="hhttps://openai.com/product">OpenAI</a> provides an API to access their models—a quick check on their website will give you the cost details.
      </li>
    </ul>

    While we’ve only scratched the surface of what's possible with Generative AI, I hope this overview inspires you to explore and integrate these tools into your work. For further insights, consider attending Women Coding Community talks, such as the London Tech Talk on <a href="#talk">Navigating LLM Deployment<sup id="fn1">2.</sup></a>, which offers tips, tricks, and techniques for practical application.
