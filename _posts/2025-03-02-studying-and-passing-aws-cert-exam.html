  <h2>Exam Overview</h2>
  <p>
    The <b><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/certification/">AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner Exam</a></b> validates foundational, high-level understanding of AWS Cloud, services, and terminology. It's an excellent starting point on the AWS Certification journey for:
    <ul>
      <li>Individuals with no prior IT or cloud experience switching to a cloud career</li>
      <li>IT professionals looking for foundational cloud literacy</li>
    </ul>
    As a Software Engineer, I have utilised some AWS services and I wanted to solidify my experience working with AWS which is why I took the exam.
  </p>

  <p>
    The exam format consists of:
    <ul>
      <li>65 questions (multiple choice or multiple response)</li>
      <li>Duration: 90 minutes</li>
      <li>Format: Online or at a testing center</li>
    </ul>
  </p>

  <h2>Study Resources</h2>
  <p>
    There are many resources available online for preparing for the exam. The ones I used and found most useful were:
  </p>

  <div>
    <p class="font-weight-bold">1. <a href="https://explore.skillbuilder.aws/">AWS Skill Builder</a> - AWS</p>
    <p>
      AWS offers free and paid learning materials to study for the exam. 
      They cover AWS Cloud concepts, core AWS services, Economics of the AWS Cloud, and Security and compliance in the AWS Cloud. 
      I used the free version and took the exam prep official question set.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div>
    <p class="font-weight-bold">2. <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/aws-certified-cloud-practitioner-new/?kw=aws&src=sac/">Ultimate AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner CLF-C02</a> - Stephane Maarek</p>
    <p>
      This Udemy course is a must watch especially if you have no experience with using AWS services. 
      It includes practical sessions of setting up and using AWS services which gets you familiar with them and in turn helps with taking the exam. 
      It is impossible to pass any of the AWS exams without familiarity with AWS services. There is a practice exam at the end of the course to help you prepare for the actual exam. 
      <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/practice-exams-aws-certified-cloud-practitioner/?couponCode=LEARNNOWPLANSGB">Practice Exams.</a>
    </p>
  </div>

  <div>
    <p class="font-weight-bold">3. <a href="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLzde74P_a04cyCsmZakYbUE5sWN9dZ-Ux&si=s2U-QmEG34qXXNye">YouTube</a></p>
    <p>
      There are different useful videos on YouTube with practice exam questions that are useful for getting familiar with exam style or question style. 
      The videos aim to explain the concepts of the questions and not just provide answers to the questions. It is a good resource to prepare for the exam.
    </p>
  </div>

  <p>
    I took notes using Notion on the core AWS services and tips that were useful in answering questions on them.
    I highly recommend taking notes as you study so you can have everything in one place to go through on the exam day. The exam itself is pretty easy if you study really well.
  </p>

  <p>
    If I had to pick just two resources, I would go with the Udemy course and the YouTube playlist. 
    Both are more than enough to pass the exam. The good thing is both resources also have other AWS Exam sets and not just the Certified Cloud Practitioner if you are writing a different exam.
  </p>

  <h2>Exam Day Strategies</h2>
  <p>
    The AWS exam tests your ability to <b>analyse scenarios and pick the best AWS solution</b>. Here's what worked for me:
  </p>

  <div>
    <p><span class="font-weight-bold">1. Be relaxed and settled: </span>
      Skim through your notes on exam day to reinforce key concepts.</p>
  </div>

  <div>
    <p class="font-weight-bold">2. Time Management</p>
    <ul>
      <li><span class="font-weight-bold">First pass:</span> Answer easy questions quickly</li>
      <li><span class="font-weight-bold">Flag difficult questions</span> for review</li>
      <li><span class="font-weight-bold">Second pass:</span> Revisit flagged questions</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <p><span class="font-weight-bold">3. Elimination Technique: </span>
    If unsure, eliminate obvious wrong answers and pick the best fit.
  </p>

  <p><span class="font-weight-bold">4. Look for AWS best practices: </span>
    Prioritise scalability, security, and cost-effectiveness.
  </p>

  <p><span class="font-weight-bold">5. Be aware of tricky wording: </span>
    AWS exams sometimes use similar-sounding terms to test understanding.
  </p>

  <h2>Final Thoughts & Advice</h2>
  <p>
    <ul>
      <li> <span class="font-weight-bold">Start early and be consistent.</span> AWS exams reward hands-on practice, not just theoretical knowledge.</li>
      <li> <span class="font-weight-bold">Use multiple learning resources.</span> Videos, whitepapers, hands-on labs, and practice tests together create the best learning experience.</li>
      <li><span class="font-weight-bold">Take notes!</span> Having everything in one place to review on exam day can be invaluable.</li>
      <li><span class="font-weight-bold">Don't rush!</span> The goal is to <span class="font-weight-bold">understand AWS concepts deeply</span>, not just pass the exam.</li>
    </ul>
  </p>
