  <p>
    As a Software Engineer who has utilized some AWS services, I wanted to solidify my experience working with AWS by pursuing certification. In this blog post, I'll be sharing my experience preparing for and passing the <b>AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner</b> exam, along with resources and tips to help you succeed in your certification journey.
  </p>

  <h2>Exam Overview</h2>
  <p>
    The <b>AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner Exam</b> validates foundational, high-level understanding of AWS Cloud, services, and terminology. It's an excellent starting point on the AWS Certification journey for:
    <ul>
      <li>Individuals with no prior IT or cloud experience switching to a cloud career</li>
      <li>IT professionals looking for foundational cloud literacy</li>
    </ul>
  </p>

  <p>
    The exam format consists of:
    <ul>
      <li>65 questions (multiple choice or multiple response)</li>
      <li>Duration: 90 minutes</li>
      <li>Format: Online or at a testing center</li>
    </ul>
  </p>

  <h2>Study Resources</h2>
  <p>
    There are many resources available online for preparing for the exam. The ones I used and found most useful were:
  </p>

  <div>
    <p>
      <b>AWS Skill Builder</b>
      <ul>
        <li>AWS offers free and paid learning materials to study for the exam</li>
        <li>Covers AWS Cloud concepts, core AWS services, Economics of the AWS Cloud, and Security and compliance</li>
        <li>I used the free version and took the official exam prep question set</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
  </div>

  <div>
    <p>
      <b>Ultimate AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner CLF-C02 - Stephane Maarek</b>
      <ul>
        <li>This Udemy course is a must-watch, especially if you have no experience with AWS services</li>
        <li>Includes practical sessions for setting up and using AWS services</li>
        <li>Offers practice exams to help prepare for the actual test</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      It's impossible to pass any AWS exam without familiarity with AWS services, and this course provides hands-on experience that's invaluable.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div>
    <p>
      <b>YouTube</b>
      <ul>
        <li>Various useful videos with practice exam questions</li>
        <li>Videos explain the concepts behind questions rather than just providing answers</li>
        <li>Great resource for understanding exam and question styles</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
  </div>

  <p>
    I took notes using Notion on the core AWS services and tips that were useful in answering questions about them. I highly recommend taking notes as you study so you can have everything in one place to review on exam day.
  </p>

  <p>
    If I had to pick just two resources, I would choose the Udemy course and YouTube videos. Both are more than sufficient to pass the exam. An added benefit is that both resources also cover other AWS Exam sets beyond the Certified Cloud Practitioner.
  </p>

  <h2>Exam Day Strategies</h2>
  <p>
    The AWS exam tests your ability to <b>analyze scenarios and pick the best AWS solution</b>. Here's what worked for me:
  </p>

  <div>
    <p>
      <b>1. Be relaxed and settled</b>
      <ul>
        <li>Skim through your notes on exam day to reinforce key concepts</li>
        <li>Arrive early if taking the exam at a testing center</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
  </div>

  <div>
    <p>
      <b>2. Time Management</b>
      <ul>
        <li>First pass: Answer easy questions quickly</li>
        <li>Flag difficult questions for review</li>
        <li>Second pass: Revisit flagged questions</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
  </div>

  <div>
    <p>
      <b>3. Elimination Technique</b>
      <ul>
        <li>If unsure, eliminate obviously wrong answers and pick the best fit</li>
        <li>Look for keywords that point to specific AWS services</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
  </div>

  <div>
    <p>
      <b>4. Look for AWS best practices</b>
      <ul>
        <li>Prioritize scalability, security, and cost-effectiveness</li>
        <li>Remember AWS's shared responsibility model</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
  </div>

  <div>
    <p>
      <b>5. Be aware of tricky wording</b>
      <ul>
        <li>AWS exams sometimes use similar-sounding terms to test understanding</li>
        <li>Read questions carefully and identify what's really being asked</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
  </div>

  <h2>Final Thoughts & Advice</h2>
  <p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Start early and be consistent.</b> AWS exams reward hands-on practice, not just theoretical knowledge.</li>
      <li><b>Use multiple learning resources.</b> Videos, whitepapers, hands-on labs, and practice tests together create the best learning experience.</li>
      <li><b>Take notes!</b> Having everything in one place to review on exam day can be invaluable.</li>
      <li><b>Don't rush!</b> The goal is to understand AWS concepts deeply, not just pass the exam.</li>
    </ul>
  </p>

  <p>
    There is currently an offer for a <b>free exam retake until Feb 15, 2025</b>. You also get a 50% <b>discount voucher</b> after passing to take other AWS exams.
  </p>

  <p>
    I wish you all the best in your exam preparation and on exam day! 🚀
