# Asset Optimization Skill

Analyze and optimize website assets for performance:
- Image optimization (size, format, compression)
- CSS minification and organization
- JavaScript bundling and minification
- Font loading strategies
- Lazy loading implementation
- Caching strategies

## Process

1. Scan project for images, CSS, JS, and fonts
2. Analyze file sizes and formats
3. Check for optimization opportunities:
   - Large uncompressed images
   - Unminified CSS/JS
   - Unused CSS/JS
   - Missing lazy loading
   - Inefficient font loading
4. Provide specific optimization recommendations
5. Generate optimized versions or suggest tools

## Metrics to Check

- Total page weight
- Number of HTTP requests
- Render-blocking resources
- Image formats (WebP, AVIF support)
- Font subsetting opportunities

## Example Usage

User: "Optimize the assets for the verify page"
